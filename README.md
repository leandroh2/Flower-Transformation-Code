# Flower-Transformation-Code

---------------------
-----DESCRIPTION-----
---------------------
Description of python files to be executed

PreprocessImages: Resizes images and converts them to png as expected from the code

DatasetCreator: Expects you to create the folder structure of a VOC dataset and place the images in the JPEGImages folder. This code then automatically splits them into train and validation images, randomly shuffles them and creates
the required txt files on their required folders.

train: trains the GAN or Segmentation network in their respective folders.

test: tests the GAN or Segmentation network in their respective folders. Also outputs the desired images and stores them in an output folder by default.

---------------------
--------USAGE--------
---------------------

Start with GAN training
1) Arrange images into A and B image folders as required by the preprocessData.py file
2) Run the change directories in the preprocessData.py file to match your desired structure and run it.
3) For GAN training Run train using the line "python train.py --dataroot datasets/myData/ --cuda --size 256 --batch 4 --decay_epoch 30" or some variation you desire.

For segmentation training
1) Create the folder structure of a VOC dataset
2) Copy the images generated by the GAN in the output/B folder into the JPEGImages folder.
2) Run PreprocessImages
3) Run DatasetCreator
5) For segmentation training just run the python file, no need for added inputs.
